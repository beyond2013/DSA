# Some definitions

**Algorithm:** methods for solving problems that are suited for computer implementation.  
**Data structures:** schemes for organizing data that leave them amenable to efficient processing by an algorithm.

# Arrays
An array stores a sequence of values that are all of the same type. 
Values stored in an array can be accessed using an index(non negative integers).
