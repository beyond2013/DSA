# Data Structures and Algorithms

## Introduction
- basic terminology and concept
- relevant examples
- overview of data organization and data structures
- different operations applied to data structures
- algorithm and its complexity
- time space tradeoff 

## Basic terminology
- Data : are values or set of values
- Data item : refers to a single unit of values
- Group items: are data items that are divided into subitems
- e.g. an employee's name may be divided into first name and last name
- Elementary items: data items that are not divided into sub items
- Entity: something that has certain attributes or properties, which may be assigned values
- e.g. and employee of a particular organization



**Algorithm:** methods for solving problems that are suited for computer implementation.  
**Data structures:** schemes for organizing data that leave them amenable to efficient processing by an algorithm.

# Arrays
An array stores a sequence of values that are all of the same type. 
Values stored in an array can be accessed using an index(non negative integers).
